# WVGMO
A new cancer multi-omics subtype identification method, which is based on variational autoencoder measured by Wasserstein distance and graph autoencoder (WVGMO).
WVGMO is implemented in Python3.8 and tensorfolw2.4.0 environment. Please install the relevant dependency packages before you run it.
It should be noted that the WVAE and the GAE run independently. And the WVAE's outputs should be saved locally as the input of the GAE.
